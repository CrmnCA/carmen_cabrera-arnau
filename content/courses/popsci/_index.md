## Description

This course offers an introduction to Geographic Data Science for Public Policy. It provides a general framework to develop understanding of the ways in which geographic data analytics can be used to turn raw data into actionable information that can inform decision making. The course adopts a problem-to-solution teaching approach, defining a practical problem and illustrating how geographic data science can enable understanding to make critically informed decisions. It uses a learning-by-doing approach based on real-world examples. This also teaches how to conduct statistical and geographic data analysis in R.

## Learning outcomes

- Develop the ability to apply different methods to understand population dynamics and societal change
- Gain an appreciation of how population science approaches can produce relevant evidence to inform policy debates
- Develop critical awareness of modern demographic analysis and ethical considerations in the use of digital footprint data.
